# Houdini Engine for Unity
Houdini Engine for Unity is a Unity plug-in that allows deep integration of
Houdini technology into Unity through the use of Houdini Engine.

This plug-in brings Houdini's powerful and flexible procedural workflow into
Unity through Houdini Digital Assets. Artists can interactively adjust the
asset's parameters inside Unity, and use Unity geometries as an asset's inputs.
Houdini's procedural engine will then "cook" the asset and the results will be
available right inside Unity.

The plug-in is currently released as a public preview. During the experimental
testing period, the Unity plug-in will be available freely.

The easiest way for artists to access the plug-in is to download the latest
production build of 32-bit Houdini or the [FREE Houdini Apprentice Learning
Edition](http://www.sidefx.com/index.php?option=com_download&task=apprentice&Itemid=208)
and install the Unity plug-in along with the Houdini interactive software.
Houdini Digital Assets created in either Houdini or Apprentice can then be
loaded into Unity through the plug-in. A growing library of Digital Assets for
use in Unity will be available at the [Orbolt Smart 3D Asset
Store](http://www.orbolt.com/unity).
